# ScrappyNews

This application uses express, express-handlebars, body-parser, mongoose, axios, and cheerio
to scrape article information from the NPR website.  It provides article references for the
user to peruse - it provides a teaser statement regarding each article as well as a link to
allow the user to see the entire article.

Unfortunately, at time of this release, the desired functionality for the project is not
complete.  I hope to add more functionlity but at present time I am lacking the ability
for the user to add notes to each article.

Thanks for your time,
Ken
